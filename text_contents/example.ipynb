Ritchie’s “Sherlock Holmes” the legendary detective shows not only his unmatched intelligence, but also considerable physical training as well. Entangled evidence, amazing deduction of Holmes and his lively mind combine into an exciting series of grueling events. The director Guy Ritchie represents a fascinating adaptation of one of the world’s best detectives. Meet the new Sherlock Holmes! The plot is as follows: Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is rather depressed because of the possibility of Watson’s (Jude Law) marriage. His mood is also compounded by the absence of interesting cases. Trying to relax, he invents a silencer, does not go out of his room, participates in fights without rules and plays violin.'"
